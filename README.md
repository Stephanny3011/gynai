# GynAI - GenAI Genesis 2025 Hackathon 🚀💡
**GynAI**  is an AI-powered health app designed for women, trans individuals, and anyone who wants to better understand hidden or misdiagnosed conditions before seeing a doctor, combining cutting-edge models like **Gemini AI**, **Cohere**, and **Google Vertex AI**.

## 🔍 The Problem
Many life-threatening conditions in women – like silent heart attacks, thyroid disorders, PCOS, hypertension, and allergies – go undetected or misdiagnosed for years. Most health tools don’t speak to women’s bodies or hormone variations. GynAI does.

## 🔍 What it does
GynAI bridges the gap between symptom onset and diagnosis by analyzing both self-reported symptoms and actual medical record data (like TSH, T3/T4, blood pressure, glucose, IgE levels, etc.) to detect risk of:
- Silent heart attacks
- Thyroid disorders (hypo/hyperthyroidism)
- PCOS
- Cardiovascular disease
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Allergies (IgE-based)

## 🛠️ How It Works
– Home Dashboard: Welcomes the user and shows quick visual insights based on questionnaire + medical data.
– Smart Questionnaire: Collects symptoms, general info, and lab values. Triggers prediction models.
– Health Chatbot: Explains possible conditions in simple terms and helps users prep questions for their doctor.
– Resources (optional): Educational content or care navigation.

## 💡 Stack

-LLMs (Gemini/Cogere) to understand symptoms and explain conditions clearly.
-Medical dataset modeling: Simulated EMRs from Canadian standards for safe testing.

Predictive engine: Trained on condition-specific thresholds and symptoms.

## 🌍 Why It Matters
  We’re building for the underserved. Women’s pain is often dismissed. Trans folks are excluded from most datasets. GynAI challenges that. It’s not just tech. It’s equity in care.
