#🧠 GynAI – AI Architecture Overview
🔹 1. Input Layer – Data Collection
## User Inputs:

Demographics: age, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, menstrual cycle, weight, etc.

Symptoms: chest pressure, fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, irregular periods, cold intolerance, etc.

Medical Records: blood pressure, TSH, T3, T4, glucose, IgE, cholesterol, etc.

Security & Format: Inputs stored temporarily (if needed), with encryption and optional on-device inference (depending on platform).

## Preprocessing Layer
Normalization of lab values into standardized units (SI, US).

Contextual Embedding for symptoms (using medical term embeddings or sentence encoders like BioBERT or ClinicalBERT).

Missing Data Handling: Imputation (mean/mode), or flagging if critical data is absent.

## Prediction Engine
A. Symptom-Based Models
Goal: Estimate likelihood of conditions using symptoms + risk factors.

Approach: Use logistic regression or shallow neural networks fine-tuned on simulated data (or public datasets like MIMIC-III or synthetic Canadian EMR data).

Conditions covered:

Heart attack (based on gender-specific symptoms)

PCOS (via Rotterdam criteria proxy)

Thyroid issues (symptoms + lab correlation)

Allergies (based on symptoms and IgE)

B. Lab-Based Threshold Models
Simple Rules or Decision Trees:

TSH > X, T4 < Y → Likely hypothyroidism

BP > 140/90 → Hypertension

Glucose > 126 fasting → Diabetes

IgE > 100 → Elevated allergy marker

These are layered on top of the symptom-based predictions for hybrid validation.

🔹 4. Natural Language Layer (LLMs)
A. Gemini / Cogere / GPT-like model
Input: User responses, symptom descriptions, and prediction outputs.

Purpose:

Translate raw predictions into plain-language explanations

Generate questions for doctors (e.g., “Can I get tested for PCOS?”)

Answer health-related queries (FAQs, symptom meanings)

Example prompt to LLM:
“Explain why this user might be at risk of hypothyroidism given their lab values (TSH: 6.1, T3: low, symptoms: cold intolerance, fatigue)”

🔹 5. Output Layer – UI Feedback
Risk levels shown with color-coded cards (Red = High risk, Yellow = Mild concern, Green = Normal)

Plain language explanation of conditions and recommended next steps.

Bot prep section: "Ask your doctor" generated checklist.

🔹 6. Ethics & Bias Mitigation
Built-in reminders that predictions are not diagnoses

Inclusive design: asks for gender identity, not just binary sex.

Tracks and adjusts for demographic skews in dataset representation.

Avoids reinforcement of sexist/biased medical assumptions (e.g., “men feel chest pain, women just feel anxiety”).

🛠️ Optional (Advanced layer)
On-device inference for privacy (CoreML or TensorFlow Lite)

Feedback loop: user updates with confirmed diagnosis → future model fine-tuning (if privacy policy allows)
